# Hey, I’m David.

I’m a senior technical leader with over 15 years of experience across software, data engineering, and AI systems, with a strong hands-on engineering background. My work has consistently focused on designing, industrialising, and operating production-grade platforms in data-intensive environments.

I specialise in building reliable, scalable data platforms and backend systems that support complex business workflows, APIs, and decision-critical applications. Alongside this foundation, I design and integrate applied AI solutions - including LLM-based systems, RAG architectures, and MLOps pipelines - with a strong emphasis on robustness, observability, and long-term production viability.

While my primary focus today is on technical leadership, architecture, and platform strategy, I deliberately remain hands-on through selected professional and personal projects. This allows me to validate architectural decisions, stay grounded in real-world constraints, and design systems that are both technically sound and operationally viable at scale.

Through these projects, I work end-to-end across the system lifecycle - from architecture and data modelling to deployment, monitoring, and operational reliability - with a constant focus on trade-offs, maintainability, and long-term business value.

Outside of engineering, I’m into trail running and ultra-endurance. If you’re ever around Lyon and feel like chatting about systems, data, or AI - or going for a run - feel free to reach out.
